// Items in a list:
// - Xfmt wraps long lines at 80 characters, configurable through -width. But it
// counts text width excluding indenting and markup. Fmt formats to a max line
// length that includes indenting. We don't care about total max line length
// nowadays, we care about a human readable paragraph, which has a certain text
// width regardless of indent.
// - Xfmt recognizes lines with first non-whitespace of "//" and "#" as line
// comments, and repeats that prefix on later lines.
