Xfmt wraps long lines at 80 characters, configurable through -width. But it
counts text width excluding indenting and markup. Fmt formats to a max line
length that includes indenting. We don't care about total max line length
nowadays, we care about a human readable paragraph, which has a certain text
width regardless of indent.
